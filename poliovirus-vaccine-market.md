<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poliovirus Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)</li><li>Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The poliovirus vaccine market consists of two primary types: Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). IPV is administered via injection, using killed virus to induce immunity without risk of disease transmission. OPV, given orally, contains live attenuated virus, stimulating robust immunity but with a rare risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus. Both vaccines are crucial for polio eradication efforts, with IPV being preferred in developed regions and OPV remaining essential in areas with ongoing transmission.</p></p>
